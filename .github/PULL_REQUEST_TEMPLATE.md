## Optimization

<!-- One sentence describing your optimization. Human-readable only; not scored. -->

## Submission payload

<!-- Fill in every field. Schema: payload-schema.json. `signature` is your SN74 hotkey signing the
     message `<commit_sha>:<kernel_sha256>:<kernel_type>`. `claimed_speedup` is advisory only —
     the canonical rerun is authoritative. -->

## Acknowledgements

- [ ] I read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/zeokin/Cuda-Compute-OSS/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [DESIGN.md](https://github.com/zeokin/Cuda-Compute-OSS/blob/main/DESIGN.md).
- [ ] This PR changes **only** `kernel.py` — no other file is added, modified, or removed.
- [ ] `kernel.py` is a real **Triton** kernel: it does **not** delegate the computation to `torch.matmul`/`mm`/`bmm`, `torch.nn.functional.*`, the `@` operator, `torch.ops.aten.*`, cuBLAS/cuDNN, or inline CUDA-C (see CONTRIBUTING § No delegation).
- [ ] My SN74 hotkey is bound to this GitHub identity and the payload signature verifies.
- [ ] I self-scored locally and got `correctness: PASS` on the declared track.
